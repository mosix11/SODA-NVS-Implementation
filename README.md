# Minimal Implementation of SODA for Novel View Synthesis

This repository contains a minimal implementation of the SODA method proposed in the paper [SODA: Bottleneck Diffusion Models for Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17901). This implementation is just a simplified version of the Novel View Synthesis task on 3D datasets experimented in the paper. I used NMR (Neural 3D Mesh Renderer) dataset hosted by [Niemeyer et al](https://github.com/autonomousvision/differentiable_volumetric_rendering) using SoftRas split. It could be applicable to other datasets aswell but the configuration files need to be modified.
